## Preambel

**Duo Color** is a template for the static site generator [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/)
and its [blog extension](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/).

It features a responsive HTML5 CSS3 based design based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
which makes it easy to modify.

## Live Demo

## Features

This template incorporates a lot of features:

* LaTeX formulas using [MathJax](http://mathjax.org), see [demo](demo/)
* syntax highlighting using pygmentize-compatible [Rouge](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rouge/) which looks exactly like embedded gists, see [demo](demo/)
* Middleman uses the kramdown markdown parser by default, which makes it very to use table of contents (TOC), see [original post](http://blog.riemann.cc/2013/04/10/table-of-contents-in-octopress/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) is used to ease the updating of javascript libs (modernizer, jquery)
* this templates comes not only with a `robots.txt`, but also with a `humans.txt`
* to help search engines to find your content, a `sitemap.txt` and `sitemap.xml` is generated for you
* blog search provided by [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
* you do not only get one feed for your blog posts, but also feeds separted by tags (middleman proxies to the win)
* all css files and javascript files are jointly minified to save bandwith and elements to loads
* nice icon fonts [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) (see [demo](demo/) and [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) at your disposal
* disqus recent comments for your blog as aside
* disqus number of comments per post on your blog post overview page

There have been made some attempts to increase the privacy of visitors:

* we host most js and css ourself (not the mathjax one, if you use it; not the Google Webfont)
* we use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) instead of google
* For sure, you better don't use Google Analytics. If you do, the provided script
  lets google remove the last bits of the IP address.
* Be aware that embedding widgets (G+, Twitter, Gist) will reveal information about your visitors to these services.

The template is somehow prepared for hosting on github, that's why the errorpage
will be named `404.html`. If you have a custom domain, you may want to add a `CNAME`
file to the `source` directory.

## Checklist

* read the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) docs
* check `data/site.yml`
* check `config.rb`
* check updates of javascript lists: `bower install`, `bower update`
* decide, if you want to add a `CNAME` file if you use github
* if you want to use more than one language, consider which naming scheme you want to use:
  If you tweak it the right way, you can use Apaches content-negotiation feature to direct
  your visitors directly to the appropiate landing page using their browser language settings.
* setup your `.htaccess` file to use the error page `404.html` or change its name
* there is a placeholder picture in the file `404.html` â€“ take another one!
* The duckduckgo results page is customized by some post variables next to the
  search string. Have a look in `_site-search.slim` to make it fit your needs
* add the missing lines to ease your deployment: `middleman-deploy`
* comment in one of the tracking snippets if you want to use Google or Piwik Analytics
